A test displaying a triangle in accordance to input

1. 


2. To calculate the angles, I first calculated the length of the sides of the Triangle.
I did this by using Pythagoras: 
d = sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)

Then I used the law of cosines:
cos(A) = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

And I calculated each angle accordingly.

3. The challenging part was the drawing of the triangle and especially the angles, as I had not dealt with
this particular problem in a web front-end context before
